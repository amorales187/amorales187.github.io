While technology is advancing at exponential rates, data is forming and being collected at quicker speeds. In fields, such as academia or science, ideas are producing new data to be managed and collected. In the internet realm, users are sharing their data and contributing to the massive data production as they are creating new accounts or simply navigating the web.

Data is everywhere and continues to be massively produced. 

As a first year MLIS student at UCLA, I am exploring data science and user experience and focusing on the ethical issues of data privacy. Inspired by the Data Practicesâ€™ s Global Data Ethics Pledge, I declare to practice and continuing valuing the following approach to data science:

Asses: Assess and understand data to solve real-world problems
Mitigate Bias: Recognize and mitigate bias within myself and datasets
Empowerment: Use data to empower others 
Privacy: Protect and secure user data
